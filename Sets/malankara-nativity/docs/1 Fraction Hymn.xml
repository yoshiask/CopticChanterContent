            <Stanza>The Wise Men learned that a star / which shone brighter than the sun / Had been born and taken flesh / By the Word of the Father</Stanza>
            <Stanza>They journeyed to Bethlehem / To behold that wondrous star / And they came bearing their gifts / Which they offered unto Him</Stanza>
            <Stanza>As the Magi reached the cave / They witnessed the angels there / And they saw David's daughter / Mary, who gave birth to God.</Stanza>
            <Stanza>The Wise Men saw the infant / Who was wrapped in swaddling clothes / And rejoiced for they witnessed / The child laid in the manger</Stanza>
            <Stanza>With the angels they rejoiced / "Glory be to God on High / And on earth peace and good-hope / and praise to God forever!"</Stanza>
